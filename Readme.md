## Food Delivary App (A Swiggy Clone using Live Data Api)

This GitHub repository contains an Swiggy clone project that aims to replicate some of the core features of the famous food delivary(named Swiggy) platform. While the project is functional and provides a basic user experience, it's essential to note that it lacks certain features, including Stripe payment integration, and may have a few bugs.

# Features

- Swiggy's All restaurant Data: User can access all the restaurants with data like restaurant menu, ratings, cusines and offer available in our application.
- Searching and filtering top restaurants: User can search their favourite restaurant of Swiggy in our app and filter restaurant based on less than 3 star rating.
- Cart management system: Leveraged Redux to streamline cart management, ensuring a smooth user experience with seamless addition and removal of menu items.
- Shimmer page and lazy loading: Our food delivery app sets a new standard in speed and user satisfaction with a shimmer page feature for lightning-fast loading. With intelligent lazy loading, users access content instantly, ensuring an unparalleled, seamless experience.
